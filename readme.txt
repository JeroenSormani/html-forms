Not just another forms plugin.

== Description ==

HTML Forms is not just another form plugin and certainly not just another form builder.

While form builders can be great for some, they are also severely limiting your flexibility.
Add to that the performance loss that comes with generating HTML from a dynamic configuration and we're convinced a simpler alternative exists.

HTML Forms is that simpler alternative. It takes a different approach by granting you full control over the form code by accepting raw HTML.
This means that you have full control over the mark-up of your form fields. No limitations.

== Installation ==

1. In your WordPress admin panel, go to *Plugins > New Plugin*, search for **HTML Forms** and click "*Install now*"
1. Alternatively, download the plugin and upload the contents of `html-forms.zip` to your plugins directory, which usually is `/wp-content/plugins/`.
1. Activate the plugin
